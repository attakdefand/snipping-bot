## System Overview

The Snipping Bot is a high-frequency trading system designed to identify and execute profitable trades across multiple blockchain networks. The system consists of several microservices that work together to:

- Monitor decentralized exchanges for new trading pairs
- Analyze market conditions using machine learning models
- Execute trades through various execution modes (mempool, private transactions, bundles)
- Manage risk through sophisticated risk controls
- Track performance and generate analytics

### Key Services

1. **svc-gateway** - Entry point for external signals and commands
2. **svc-strategy** - Signal processing and trade plan generation
3. **svc-executor** - Trade execution across different modes
4. **svc-risk** - Risk management and compliance checks
5. **svc-dashboard** - Monitoring and visualization interface
6. **svc-analytics** - Performance analytics and reporting

## Deployment Procedures

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Kubernetes cluster (for production)
- Access to blockchain RPC endpoints
- Properly configured secrets and environment variables

### Deployment Steps

1. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd snipping-bot
   
   # Set up environment variables
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with appropriate values
   ```

2. **Configuration**
   - Review and update configuration files in `configs/` directory
   - Ensure all secrets are properly configured
   - Verify network and RPC endpoint configurations

3. **Build Services**
   ```bash
   # Build all services
   docker-compose build
   
   # Or build specific services
   docker-compose build svc-strategy svc-executor
   ```

4. **Start Services**
   ```bash
   # Start all services
   docker-compose up -d
   
   # Start specific services
   docker-compose up -d svc-strategy svc-executor
   ```

5. **Verify Deployment**
   - Check service logs: `docker-compose logs -f <service-name>`
   - Verify service health endpoints
   - Confirm connectivity to blockchain networks

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Trade Execution**
   - Successful trades per minute
   - Failed trade attempts
   - Average execution latency
   - Gas usage statistics

2. **Signal Processing**
   - Signals received per minute
   - Trade plans generated
   - ML model confidence scores
   - Processing latency

3. **Risk Metrics**
   - Risk checks performed
   - Trades blocked by risk controls
   - Position size limits
   - Correlation violations

4. **System Health**
   - Service uptime
   - Memory and CPU usage
   - Disk space utilization
   - Network connectivity

### Alerting Thresholds

- **Critical**: Trade execution failure rate > 5%
- **Warning**: Trade execution latency > 500ms
- **Info**: New trading pair detected
- **Critical**: Risk check failures > 10 per minute

### Monitoring Tools

- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for dashboard visualization
- Alertmanager for alert routing
- Custom health check endpoints

## Incident Response

### Common Issues and Resolution

1. **Trade Execution Failures**
   - Check RPC endpoint connectivity
   - Verify gas price configurations
   - Review transaction simulation results
   - Examine blockchain network congestion

2. **Signal Processing Delays**
   - Check service CPU/memory usage
   - Review ML model performance
   - Examine message queue backlog
   - Verify network connectivity

3. **Risk Control Blocks**
   - Review blocked trade details
   - Check correlation data sources
   - Verify risk parameter configurations
   - Examine recent market conditions

### Escalation Procedures

1. **Level 1**: System alerts - Automated notifications to on-call engineer
2. **Level 2**: Service degradation - Manual investigation and resolution
3. **Level 3**: System outage - Team coordination and stakeholder communication
4. **Level 4**: Security incident - Security team involvement and external reporting

### Communication Plan

- Internal team: Slack/Teams channel
- Stakeholders: Email notifications
- Customers: Status page updates
- Public: Social media updates (if applicable)
