### 2. Initial Response (0-15 minutes)

1. **Acknowledge the incident**
   - Assign initial responder
   - Create incident ticket
   - Notify incident response team

2. **Assess impact**
   - Determine affected services
   - Estimate user impact
   - Classify severity level

3. **Begin documentation**
   - Record incident details
   - Log initial findings
   - Capture relevant metrics

### 3. Investigation (15 minutes - 2 hours)

1. **Gather information**
   - Check service logs
   - Review monitoring data
   - Examine recent changes
   - Interview affected users

2. **Identify root cause**
   - Analyze system behavior
   - Review recent deployments
   - Check for external factors
   - Validate hypotheses

3. **Develop resolution plan**
   - Identify potential solutions
   - Assess risks and impacts
   - Select optimal approach
   - Prepare rollback plan

### 4. Resolution (2 hours - ongoing)

1. **Implement fix**
   - Apply approved solution
   - Monitor for effectiveness
   - Document changes made
   - Communicate progress

2. **Verify resolution**
   - Confirm issue is resolved
   - Validate system functionality
   - Check for side effects
   - Monitor performance metrics

3. **Communicate status**
   - Update stakeholders
   - Provide regular progress reports
   - Announce resolution
   - Schedule post-mortem

### 5. Post-Incident Activities

1. **Post-mortem analysis**
   - Document root cause
   - Identify contributing factors
   - Review response effectiveness
   - Define preventive measures

2. **Follow-up actions**
   - Implement preventive measures
   - Update documentation
   - Train team members
   - Close incident ticket

## Common Incident Types

2. Optimize ML model performance
3. Clear message queue backlogs
4. Implement load balancing
5. Upgrade system resources

### Risk Control Blocks

**Symptoms:**
- Increased number of blocked trades
- Alert notifications for risk violations
- User reports of trading restrictions

**Investigation Steps:**
1. Review risk service logs
2. Check correlation data sources
3. Verify risk parameter configurations
4. Examine recent market conditions
5. Analyze blocked trade patterns

**Resolution Actions:**
1. Adjust risk parameters
2. Update correlation data
3. Implement temporary overrides
4. Review risk model logic
5. Coordinate with compliance team

### Security Incidents

**Symptoms:**
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Suspicious network activity
- Alert notifications for security events
- Unexplained system behavior

**Investigation Steps:**
1. Review security logs
2. Check access control records
3. Analyze network traffic
4. Verify key and secret usage
5. Examine system integrity

**Resolution Actions:**
1. Revoke compromised credentials
2. Rotate affected keys/secrets
3. Implement additional security controls
4. Coordinate with security team
5. Report to authorities (if required)
