# Checklist Tracking Guide

This guide explains how to use the checklist tracking system to monitor your progress through the enhanced trading checklist.

## Overview

The checklist tracking system consists of three main components:

1. **Progress Tracking File**: A TOML file that stores your completion status for each checklist item
2. **Validation Script**: A PowerShell script that checks your system setup and displays progress
3. **Update Script**: A PowerShell script that allows you to update your progress

## Getting Started

### 1. Initialize Progress Tracking

The first time you run the validation script, it will automatically create a progress tracking file from the template:

```powershell
./scripts/validate-trading-checklist.ps1
```

This creates `configs/checklist-progress.toml` based on `configs/checklist-progress.template.toml`.

### 2. View Your Progress

To see your current progress through the checklist:

```powershell
./scripts/validate-trading-checklist.ps1 -ShowProgress
```

This will display overall completion percentage and highlight incomplete sections.

### 3. Update Your Progress

To mark items as complete or incomplete, use the update script:

```powershell
# List all sections
./scripts/update-checklist-progress.ps1 -ListSections

# List items in a specific section
./scripts/update-checklist-progress.ps1 -ListItems -Section "pre_testing_phase.security_setup"

# Mark an item as complete
./scripts/update-checklist-progress.ps1 -Section "pre_testing_phase.security_setup" -Item "configure_secure_key_storage" -Complete

# Mark an item as incomplete
./scripts/update-checklist-progress.ps1 -Section "pre_testing_phase.security_setup" -Item "setup_firewall_rules" -Incomplete
```

## Progress Tracking File Structure

The progress tracking file is organized into sections that match the enhanced trading checklist:

- `pre_testing_phase`
- `testing_phase`
- `pre_go_live`
- `go_live`
- `ongoing_operations`
- `emergency_procedures`

Each section contains items that correspond to the checklist items.

## Best Practices

### 1. Regular Updates
Update your progress regularly as you complete checklist items to maintain an accurate picture of your readiness.

### 2. Validation Before Go-Live
Run the validation script before going live to ensure all critical systems are properly configured.

### 3. Team Coordination
If multiple team members are working on different aspects of the checklist, coordinate updates to the progress tracking file to avoid conflicts.

### 4. Backup Progress
Regularly backup your `configs/checklist-progress.toml` file, especially before making significant changes to your system.

## Troubleshooting

### Progress File Issues
If your progress file becomes corrupted or you want to start fresh:

```powershell
./scripts/validate-trading-checklist.ps1 -ResetProgress
```

This will reset your progress tracking to the template version.

### Missing Sections or Items
If you notice that some sections or items from the enhanced checklist are missing from the progress tracking file, you can manually add them to `configs/checklist-progress.toml` following the existing format.

## Integration with Other Tools

The checklist tracking system integrates with other snipping-bot tools:

- **Configuration Management**: Works with `scripts/configure-trading.ps1` to ensure strategies and risk parameters are properly set
- **Service Management**: Verifies services are running with `scripts/run-all-services.ps1` and `scripts/check-services.ps1`
- **Compliance Testing**: Complements `scripts/run_compliance_tests.ps1` by tracking compliance-related checklist items
- **Performance Monitoring**: Works alongside `scripts/monitor-performance.ps1` to ensure monitoring systems are properly configured

By using this checklist tracking system, you can ensure a methodical approach to preparing your snipping-bot for live trading while maintaining visibility into your progress.
