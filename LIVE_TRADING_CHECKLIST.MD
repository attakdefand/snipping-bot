- [ ] Monitor system performance closely
- [ ] Validate all signals and decisions
- [ ] Confirm accurate performance metrics
- [ ] Document any issues or anomalies

### Gradual Ramp-Up
- [ ] Start with small position sizes (1-2% of intended volume)
- [ ] Monitor profit and loss closely
- [ ] Gradually increase position sizes
- [ ] Watch for changes in market conditions
- [ ] Adjust strategies based on live performance

### Full Deployment
- [ ] Deploy all strategies and services
- [ ] Enable full trading capabilities
- [ ] Maintain close monitoring for first week
- [ ] Schedule regular performance reviews
- [ ] Implement continuous improvement process

## Ongoing Operations

### Daily Checks
- [ ] Review performance metrics using dashboard
- [ ] Check system health and resource usage with `./scripts/check-services.ps1`
- [ ] Monitor open positions and risk exposure
- [ ] Review and respond to alerts
- [ ] Update trading journal with observations

### Weekly Reviews
- [ ] Analyze profit and loss statements
- [ ] Review strategy performance using analytics service

- [ ] Update documentation as needed
- [ ] Plan improvements for following week

### Monthly Audits
- [ ] Conduct comprehensive system audit
- [ ] Review and update security measures
- [ ] Analyze long-term performance trends
- [ ] Update strategies based on market changes

- [ ] Document incident and root cause
- [ ] Implement preventive measures

### Security Incident
- [ ] Isolate affected systems immediately
- [ ] Change all relevant credentials
- [ ] Conduct security audit
- [ ] Notify security team and management
- [ ] Implement additional security controls

### Performance Degradation
- [ ] Identify root cause of performance issue
- [ ] Implement temporary workarounds
- [ ] Scale resources if needed
- [ ] Optimize affected components
- [ ] Monitor for recurrence

## Documentation

### Required Documents
- [ ] System architecture diagram (CORE-COMPONENT-SNIPPING-BOT.MD)
- [ ] Configuration guides for all services (TRADING_STARTUP_GUIDE.MD)
- [ ] Runbook with operational procedures
- [ ] Security policies and procedures (SECURITY_COMPLIANCE_REPORT.MD)
- [ ] Disaster recovery plan
- [ ] Compliance documentation (DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.MD)

### Maintenance Schedule
- [ ] Daily: Performance monitoring with `./scripts/monitor-performance.ps1`
- [ ] Weekly: Strategy review and optimization
- [ ] Monthly: System audit and security review
- [ ] Quarterly: Compliance verification with `./scripts/run_compliance_tests.ps1`
- [ ] Annually: Comprehensive system assessment

## Success Metrics

### Financial Metrics
- [ ] Monthly profit target
- [ ] Risk-adjusted return (Sharpe ratio)
- [ ] Maximum drawdown limits
- [ ] Win rate thresholds
- [ ] Cost per trade targets

### System Metrics
