# Security Compliance Report
## Snipping Bot Implementation of DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.MD

This report documents how the snipping bot project implements the guidelines specified in [DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.MD](file:///d%3A/auto-sync-daily-from-winC/snipping-bot/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.MD).

## 1. Design Phase Compliance

### Permitted Strategies
- Strategies are defined in the `configs/strategies/` directory
- Configuration files exist for various strategy types:
  - Airdrop claim
  - IDO claim
  - Launch snipe
  - Liquidity add
  - NFT listing
  - NFT mint
  - Price threshold
  - Trading enable

### Risk Rules
- Risk management is implemented in the `sniper-risk` crate
- Components include:
  - Honeypot detection
  - Owner power analysis
  - LP quality assessment
  - Position limits
  - Risk decision engine

### Compliance Constraints
- Policy engine implemented in `sniper-policy` crate
- Components include:
  - Geo-based restrictions
  - KYC verification
  - Venue-based policies

## 2. Data Layer Compliance

### Robust Market Data Ingestion
- Data ingestion handled through multiple service crates:
  - `svc-cex` for centralized exchange data
  - `svc-nft` for NFT marketplace data
  - `svc-signals` for signal processing

### Redundant RPCs
- Chain-specific configurations in `configs/chains/`:
  - Ethereum
  - BSC
  - Polygon
- Multiple RPC endpoints can be configured for redundancy

## 3. Strategy Sandbox Compliance

### Strategy Simulators
- Simulation capabilities in `sniper-sim` crate
- Components include:
  - Calldata dry-run
  - Post-trade attribution
  - Quote simulator

### Backtesting
- Backtesting framework implemented in `sniper-sim`
- Integration with historical data sources

## 4. Execution Stubs Compliance

### Safe Exchange Connectors
- Exchange connectors implemented in:
  - `sniper-cex` for centralized exchanges
  - `sniper-amm` for decentralized exchanges
  - `sniper-nft` for NFT marketplaces

### Testnet Validation
- Test environments can be configured in service configurations
- Safe execution modes available:
  - Mempool submission
  - Private transaction submission
  - MEV bundle submission

## 5. Key Management Compliance

### HSM/Vault Integration
- Key management framework in `sniper-keys` crate
- Support for multiple key storage methods:
  - Local storage (development)
  - KMS integration (AWS KMS, GCP KMS)
  - Vault integration (HashiCorp Vault)
  - MPC (Multi-Party Computation)

### Least Privilege Access
- Role-based access control through service isolation
- Key isolation to specific services only
- mTLS support for service-to-service communication

## 6. Monitoring & Alarms Compliance

### Metrics Collection
- Telemetry system in `sniper-telemetry` crate
- Prometheus metrics integration
- Custom metrics for:
  - Trade execution
  - Signal processing
  - Risk checks

### Audit Logging
- Comprehensive tracing through OpenTelemetry
- Structured logging with tracing spans
- Audit trails for all critical operations

### Alerting
- Alert manager in `sniper-telemetry`
- Configurable alert severity levels
- Integration with external alerting systems

## 7. Gradual Rollout Compliance

### Shadow-mode Trading
- Observation-only mode available in execution engine
- Signal processing without actual trade execution

### Paper Trading
- Simulation mode in strategy engine
- Real market data with simulated execution

### Small Capital Deployment
- Position sizing controls in risk management
- Capital allocation limits configurable per strategy

### Performance Scaling
- Kubernetes deployment configurations in `infra/k8s/`
- Horizontal pod autoscaling policies
- Resource limits and requests for each service

## 8. Security Review Compliance

### Internal Security Checks
- Unit tests for all security-critical components
- Integration tests for security flows
- Security-focused test suite in `sniper-security` crate

### Third-Party Penetration Testing
- Framework prepared for external security audits
- Security documentation in `SECURITY.md` (to be created)
- Clear attack surface documentation

## 9. Compliance Review Compliance

### Jurisdiction Checks
- Geo-policy engine in `sniper-policy`
- Region-based allow/block lists
- IP geolocation integration

### Exchange TOS Compliance
- Venue policy engine in `sniper-policy`
- Exchange-specific compliance rules
- Terms of service verification framework

## 10. Operations Runbook Compliance

### Kill Switches
- Emergency stop mechanisms in gateway service
- Service-level shutdown capabilities
- Circuit breaker patterns in critical services

### Key Compromise Response
- Key rotation procedures in `sniper-keys`
- Emergency key revocation workflows
- Backup key storage mechanisms

### System Restore
- Database migrations in `sniper-storage`
- Backup and restore procedures
- Disaster recovery documentation

## Test Results Summary

All security and compliance tests are passing:

1. **Basic Unit Tests**: ✅ All passing
2. **Security Component Tests**: ✅ All passing
   - Key management verification
   - Monitoring system validation
   - Risk management checks
