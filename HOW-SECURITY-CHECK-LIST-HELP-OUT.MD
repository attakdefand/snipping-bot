Purpose — what the security_layers_checklist gives you and how it helps

- Single source of truth for security controls and evidence
  - The CSV maps control groups → concrete controls → repo artifacts → test categories → KPIs. That gives you an auditable, machine-readable inventory to answer “what controls do we have, where are the configs/docs, and how do we test them?”.
  - Helps during audits and gap analysis: auditors can inspect the CSV and then request the referenced artifacts.

- Operationalizes security into testable requirements
  - Each row ties a control to a Test Category (e.g., “SAST, Secret Leak Tests”, “DR Drills”, “Soak/Stress Tests”). That makes it straightforward to convert policies into CI jobs and test suites.
  - Enables “policy-as-code” and automated checks: CI can fail a PR if required artifacts are missing or checks don’t pass.

- Drives measurable security KPIs and continuous improvement
  - The Metric/KPI column gives measurable signals (e.g., % policy coverage, # leaks blocked, RPO/RTO).
  - Use these KPIs to track improvement over time and to prioritize engineering/security work.

- Improves traceability & evidence collection
  - The Evidence to Store column tells you what to keep (attestations, logs, restore reports). That ensures you can prove a control was executed and capture artifacts in CI (upload artifacts, SBOMs, cosign attestations).

- Prioritizes remediation & risk management
  - The checklist helps to map high-risk areas (AuthN/AuthZ, Secrets, DB privileges, Supply Chain) to concrete actions, enabling targeted remediation and measurable change.

- Helps align engineering and security teams
  - Developers get clear actionable items in the repo (e.g., “add .gitleaks.toml”, “create docs/security/POLICY-CATALOG.md”) instead of vague security requests.
  - Code owners and owners in the CSV can be used to automate ticketing, reviewer assignment, and escalation.

How you should use it (practical & immediate)

1) Enforce existence and completeness in CI (recommended)
- Add a validation job that ensures:
  - Required columns are present and not empty.
  - Referenced artifacts (files in Policy/Config Artifact) exist.
  - Layer numbers and Test Category fields are sane.
- I previously provided a validator (ci/validate_security_checklist.py) and a workflow (.github/workflows/validate-security-checklist.yml). Run that on PRs so contributors get immediate feedback.

2) Turn rows into automated tests / CI gates
- Example mappings:
  - “SAST/Secret Scan” → run cargo-deny / gitleaks / trufflehog in ci-security.yml.
  - “SBOM / dependency health” → generate SBOM (syft) and run cargo-audit / cargo-deny in a scheduled job.
  - “Sigstore / cosign” → verify cosign signatures on release artifacts during publish workflow.
  - “DR drills / backups” → automation that runs restore job on staging and uploads evidence.

3) Wire KPIs into dashboards and GitHub artifacts
- Emit KPIs from CI runs (upload reports, SARIF, tarpaulin XML, SBOMs).
- Store evidence as artifacts or push to a central evidence bucket (S3) with metadata (control id, run id, timestamp).
- Use simple naming convention: evidence/<control-id>/<run-id>/… so auditors can find proof.

4) Gate merges with policy checks and branch protection
- Implement required checks in GitHub branch protection:
  - “validate-security-checklist” (CSV validator)
  - “ci-fast” (fmt/clippy/build/unit)
  - “security-scan” (cargo-audit/cargo-deny/gitleaks)
- Make merging contingent on those checks passing.

5) Automate SBOM / supply-chain attestations
- Produce SBOM on every build and store it (e.g., sbom/syft.spdx.json).
- Sign release artifacts using cosign and capture attestations/verification as CI steps.

6) Convert items into actionable work
- Use the CSV to create issues/epics for missing artifacts:
  - If Policy/Config Artifact points to docs/security/POLICY-CATALOG.md and that file is missing, open an issue assigned to the codeowner.
- Use CODEOWNERS to route PR reviews for security artifacts.

7) Implement evidence collection & retention policy
- In CI, upload artifacts produced by security checks:
  - SARIF (static analysis), tarpaulin coverage, SBOM, cosign attestations, backup/restore logs, DAST reports.
- Retain a copy in a secure storage location for the audit window required by your compliance needs.

Concrete CI checklist items you can implement now

- Validate CSV on PRs (validator + workflow). Example workflow excerpt I suggested earlier: .github/workflows/validate-security-checklist.yml + ci/validate_security_checklist.py.
- Add a security workflow that runs:
  - cargo-deny / cargo-audit
  - gitleaks (repo secret scan)
  - SBOM generation (syft) and upload
  - cosign verification for artifacts (on release)
- Add scheduled scans:
  - nightly cargo-audit and SBOM drift check
  - weekly DAST/DAST probes and dependency update scans
- Add required repo secrets and variables:
  - TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID (for notifications)
  - COSIGN_KEY or Sigstore configuration (for artifact signing)
  - RUN_REDIS_TESTS / RUN_DB_TESTS (CI gates)
- Add branch protection rules and required status checks (validate CSV, security-scan, ci-fast).

Example of immediate wins
- Ensure “Secrets Scanning” control has .gitleaks.toml and a CI job that blocks pushes with clear error messages. That immediately reduces leak risk.
- Ensure “SCA/SBOM” control outputs an SBOM file per build and stores it in sbom/. Add a CI job to compare SBOMs across releases (SBOM diff test).
- Implement “Build Integrity” control: sign release artifacts and check signatures in CI before publish.

Reference to the repo file you previously saw
- For guarding Redis-dependent tests, update the test in crates/sniper-storage/src/redis_locks.rs so it skips unless RUN_REDIS_TESTS=true (see file at ref 03b0f8d6662e7213ade1553befe5d385a49cd7f7). This avoids CI failures when services are not available.

Suggested next steps (pick 2 to start)
1. Add the CSV validator + workflow to CI so PRs fail fast on missing artifacts.
2. Create a security workflow (ci-security.yml) that runs cargo-audit, cargo-deny, gitleaks, and generates an SBOM.
3. Implement artifact signing verification (cosign) in your release pipeline.
4. Map 10 highest-risk CSV rows into prioritized issues and assign owners.

If you want, I will:
- produce the exact validator script and the validate-security-checklist.yml file (ready to copy), or
- generate the full set of CI workflows we discussed (security + fast + integration + nightly) as files you can commit, or
- create an issues list from the CSV (missing artifacts / files) so you can assign work.

Which of the three would you like me to do next?
