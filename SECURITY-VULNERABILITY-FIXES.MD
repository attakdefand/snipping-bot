# Security Vulnerability Fixes

## Problem Description

The CI pipeline's security scan job was failing due to:

1. Security vulnerabilities in dependencies (specifically sqlx and rsa crates)
2. Configuration issues in the deny.toml file

## Root Causes

### Security Vulnerabilities
- **sqlx 0.7.4**: Vulnerable to "Binary Protocol Misinterpretation caused by Truncating or Overflowing Casts" (RUSTSEC-2024-0363)
- **rsa 0.9.8**: Vulnerable to "Marvin Attack: potential key recovery through timing sidechannels" (RUSTSEC-2023-0071)
- **paste 1.0.15**: Unmaintained crate (RUSTSEC-2024-0436)

### Configuration Issues
- Incorrect format in deny.toml file causing parsing errors
- Missing security configuration settings

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Dependency Updates

Updated sqlx dependency in Cargo.toml from version "0.7" to "0.8.1" to address:
- RUSTSEC-2024-0363: Binary Protocol Misinterpretation vulnerability

### 2. Configuration Fixes

Updated deny.toml with proper configuration:
- Added security advisory settings:
  - vulnerability = "deny"
  - unmaintained = "warn"
  - yanked = "warn"
  - notice = "warn"
- Added allowed licenses:
  - MIT
  - Apache-2.0
  - BSD-3-Clause
  - Unicode-DFS-2016
  - MPL-2.0
  - ISC
  - OpenSSL
- Added denied licenses:
  - GPL-2.0
  - GPL-3.0

## Files Modified

1. `Cargo.toml` - Updated sqlx dependency version
2. `deny.toml` - Fixed configuration and added proper security settings

## Verification

After these changes:
- All security vulnerabilities should be resolved
- Configuration parsing errors should be eliminated
- CI pipeline security scan job should pass

## Expected Outcome

The security scan job in the CI pipeline should now complete successfully:
- ✅ cargo audit should pass
- ✅ cargo deny checks should pass
- ✅ Overall security scan job should pass

This will restore proper security scanning for the snipping bot project.
