Awesome—let’s turn “backtest” into a first-class, production-grade capability for your Rust snipping bot (Sniper-RS). Below is a complete **feature map** (main types → sub-types → components), plus everything you want **beyond backtests**, and exactly **how it plugs into your bot** so you can run it end-to-end with confidence.

---

# Backtesting: Main Types → Sub-types → Components

## 1) Historical Backtest (classic, offline)

**Goal:** Replay past markets to evaluate a strategy with accurate costs and constraints.
**Sub-types**

* **Bar-based**: OHLCV on fixed intervals (1s/1m/5m/1h).
* **Event-driven tick**: Every trade/quote update, true microstructure.
* **Order-book level**: Full L2/L3 book replay, queue position modeling.
* **On-chain blocks** (DEX): Block-by-block with mempool timing, AMM math.
* **Cross-asset/portfolio**: Multiple symbols/venues/correlated assets.
* **Regime-aware**: Split by volatility regimes/bull–bear/liquidity states.

**Core Components**

* **Data Layer**

  * Market adapters (CEX REST/WS dumps, DEX on-chain, parquet/CSV).
  * Book/tick compactor, resampler, corporate action & split adjuster.
  * Time alignment (multi-venue clock), missing-data handlers, session calendars.
* **Trading Clock & Scheduler**

  * Deterministic, pausable, time-warp controls, market sessions/holidays.
* **Microstructure & Execution Simulator**

  * Order types: MKT/LMT/IOC/FOK/PO; post-only, hidden/iceberg (CEX).
  * **Fill model**: queue position, partial fills, adverse selection.
  * **Slippage model**: spread, impact (Kyle’s λ), book-walk depth caps.
  * **Fees**: maker/taker tiers, gas fees (DEX), funding (perps), borrow.
  * **Latency**: send/ack/venue/clock skew, retry, network jitter.
  * **Circuit constraints**: price bands, auction/open/close, downtime.
  * **AMM math (DEX)**: CPMM/CLAMM, price impact, pool fee tiers, TWAP.
* **Risk Engine**

  * Position sizing (fixed, %NAV, volatility targeting, Kelly-fraction capped).
  * Limits: max position/gamma/leverage/VaR, daily loss, cooldowns.
  * Portfolio constraints: sector/coin exposure, correlation caps.
* **Strategy API**

  * Deterministic inputs (features, signals), stateless/stateful modes.
  * Warm-up windows, feature store, label leakage guards.
* **Accounting & PnL**

  * Realized/unrealized, mark-to-mid/last/bid/ask, FIFO/LIFO lots.
  * Multi-currency NAV with FX, stablecoin pegs.
* **Metrics & Reports**

  * Returns: daily/periodic, p50/p95/p99 drawdowns.
  * Risk: Sharpe/Sortino/Calmar/Ulcer, turnover, capacity.
  * Trade stats: win rate, RR, MAE/MFE, heatmaps by hour/day/venue.
  * Attribution: alpha by feature/signal/bucket; slippage & fee TCA.
  * Stability: sensitivity curves vs N (slippage/fees/latency).

## 2) Walk-Forward & Robustness Testing

**Sub-types**

* **Walk-forward optimization (WFO)**: Rolling train→test windows.
* **K-fold temporal CV**: Non-overlapping time folds.
* **Regime split**: Train in low-vol, test in high-vol, and vice versa.
* **Stress windows**: Crash weeks, illiquidity, exchange outages.
  **Components**
* Hyperparameter search (grid/random/Bayesian/Optuna).
* Early-stopping vs overfit guards (Deflated Sharpe checks).
* **Bootstrap/Monte-Carlo** on trade sequences (permute gaps, shard markets).
* **Alternative fills** simulation: optimistic/median/pessimistic.

## 3) Paper-Trade Backtest (“Live-Replay” with real clock)

**Sub-types**

* **Accelerated replay** (2×/10×) on recent history.
* **Shadow mode**: Strategy sends orders to simulator while production runs.
  **Components**
* Real exchange adapters replaced by simulator endpoints.
* Live dashboards: latency histograms, expected vs simulated fills.

## 4) On-chain Fork Testing (DEX-focused)

**Sub-types**

* **Mainnet-fork** replay at specific block ranges.
* **MEV scenario** simulation: pool snipes, sandwich protection checks.
  **Components**

## 5) Portfolio / Multi-Venue Backtest

**Sub-types**

* **Smart-router** simulation across venues/AMMs/CEXs.
* **Inventory-aware MM** backtest (internalization vs external routes).
  **Components**
* Venue selection policy (fees, liquidity, reliability scores).
* Cross-venue latency matrix, failover behaviors.

# Beyond Backtests: What else should you have?

1. **Forward Testing Suite**

* **Paper Trading (live market, no capital)**
* **Shadow/Canary**: 1–5% flow through the new executor; compare slippage vs control.
* **Kill-switches**: drawdown, anomalous spread, liquidity vacuum.

2. **Live Execution Controls**

* Throttle/ratelimit, dedup, idempotent order keys, replay guards.
* Venue health scores, **automatic venue failover**.
* Risk caps per symbol/day/venue; circuit breaker by volatility.

3. **Research & Experiment Platform**

* **Experiment tracker** (params → metrics → artifacts).
* **Feature store** (versioned transforms w/ leakage checks).
* **Model registry** (if ML signals): promote via policy gates.

4. **Scenario & Chaos Packs**

* Exchange outage, delayed acks, stale book, widened spread.
* DEX: gas spikes, mempool floods, sandwichers; **block reorgs**.
* **What-if engine**: change fee tier/latency and recompute PnL.

5. **TCA & Capacity Analysis**

* Real vs sim slippage, venue hit ratio, queue-position decay.
* Capacity curves: PnL vs notional, participation %, market impact.

6. **Compliance & Audit**

* Deterministic seeds, reproducible runs, signed artifacts.
* Full trade & decision logs (feature vector snapshots).
* Policy approvals (pre-trade checks documented).

7. **Observability**

* **Golden signals**: latency, error, throughput, saturation.
* Strategy metrics: signal drift, live-vs-backtest variance alarms.
* Post-trade health: reject spikes, cancel/replace loops.

8. **Data Ops**

* Data lineage, schema contracts, quality monitors (gaps, outliers).
* Synthetic data generators for rare events.

# How this plugs into your Snipping Bot (Sniper-RS)

Your bot typically has these crates/services: **strategy**, **risk**, **executor**, **policy gatekeeper**, **market adapters**, **analytics**, and **dashboard**. We wire the Backtest Engine as a **drop-in venue** + **deterministic clock**.

## Event Bus & Topics (NATS JetStream example)

* `strategy.signal.{symbol}` → generated signals
* `order.new` / `order.cancel` → from strategy to executor
* `fill.executed` → from executor (sim or live) to accounting
* `risk.alert` / `policy.blocked` → risk/policy feedback
* `metrics.trade`, `metrics.latency` → analytics pipeline

In **backtest mode**, the **Execution Simulator** publishes `fill.executed` instead of a live venue adapter. Everything else stays the same.

## Minimal Rust Interfaces (sketch)

```rust
pub trait MarketDataFeed {
    fn subscribe(&mut self, symbol: &str);
    fn next_event(&mut self) -> Option<MarketEvent>; // tick/book/bar/block
}

pub trait ExecutionModel {
    fn on_order(&mut self, ts: i64, order: Order) -> Vec<Fill>;
    fn set_latency_model(&mut self, lm: Box<dyn LatencyModel>);
    fn set_fee_model(&mut self, fm: Box<dyn FeeModel>);
    fn set_slippage_model(&mut self, sm: Box<dyn SlippageModel>);
}

pub trait RiskEngine {
    fn check(&self, state: &PortfolioState, intent: &OrderIntent) -> RiskDecision;
}

pub struct BacktestEngine<M: MarketDataFeed, E: ExecutionModel, R: RiskEngine> {
    pub clock: SimClock,
    pub feed: M,
    pub exec: E,
    pub risk: R,
    pub accounting: Accounting,
}
```

## Execution Models you’ll want

* **CEXLimitOrderBookExec**: queue position, depth walk, partial fills.
* **AMMExec**: CPMM/CLAMM math, pool fee tier, price impact, gas fee.
* **HybridRouterExec**: venue selection by effective cost & latency.

## Deterministic Clock & Reproducibility

* RunIDs + seeds → all stochastic parts (slippage/latency) are reproducible.
* Wall-clock is independent; time advances only by event timestamps.

## Config Example (TOML)

```toml
[run]
mode = "backtest"        # backtest | paper | live
start = "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z"
end   = "2023-04-01T00:00:00Z"
symbols = ["ETH/USDT","ARB/USDT"]

[exec]
model = "AMMExec"        # or CEXLimitOrderBookExec
latency_ms = { send=12, venue=18, ack=6 }
slippage = { model="impact", k=0.85 }  # impact coefficient
fees = { taker_bps=7.0, maker_bps=2.0, gas_usd=0.12 }

[risk]
max_leverage = 2.0
max_daily_loss_bps = 150
max_pos_notional_usd = 50000

[accounting]
base_ccy = "USD"
mark = "mid"             # mid | last | bidask
```

## NATS Subjects (sim)

* Backtest publishes market events to `md.event.replay.*`
* Strategy subscribes normally; Executor writes to `fill.executed` from sim.
* Dashboard reads both **expected** vs **actual** fills to show slippage delta.

---

# Acceptance Gates (what “working fine” means)

* **Reproducible**: same seed → same trades, same PnL.
* **Tracking Error**: live paper vs backtest slippage Δ within X bps.
* **Latency SLOs**: p95 decision→submit < 40 ms (example); no long tails.
* **Risk Conformance**: zero violations in tests; kill-switch fired correctly in chaos scenarios.
* **Data Integrity**: no time regressions, no cross-symbol leakage.
* **Attribution Clarity**: ≥90% of PnL explained by measured factors (fees, slippage, timing).

---

# Test Packs you can run (copy-ready ideas)

**Backtest correctness**

* Unit: fee, slippage, AMM tick, queue position calculators.
* Property tests: no negative inventory; PnL additivity; idempotent cancels.
* Golden tests: known data slice → fixed PnL JSON snapshot.

**Robustness**

* Monte-Carlo resample trade order; bootstrapped days; widen spread by 2×.
* Latency chaos: +50ms jitter; 1% lost acks; venue downtime at open.

**DEX specifics**

* Gas surge 5×; sandwich attempt window; 2-block reorg mid-trade.

**Performance**

* 1 month, L3 book, 10 symbols under N seconds; memory cap under M GB.

---

# What to build first (short path)

1. **Deterministic SimClock** + **CSV/Parquet Feed** (bars/ticks).
2. **AMMExec** and **CEX LOB Exec** with fee/slip/latency plug-ins.
3. **Accounting + Reports** (PnL, drawdown, Sharpe, TCA).
4. **Walk-Forward Harness** (rolling windows + Optuna/Bayes).
5. **Paper Mode** (same API, real clock).
6. **Dashboards**: PnL curve, slippage breakdown, capacity curve.
7. **Chaos/Scenario** library (gas spike, outage, reorg, wide spread).

---

# Quick wiring to your bot

* Keep your **strategy/risk/executor** traits identical in **backtest** and **live**; swap only the **execution adapter** (sim vs venue).
* Send/receive via the same NATS subjects; choose the **runner** with `mode=backtest|paper|live` in config.
* Persist every run’s artifacts (config, metrics.json, fills.parquet, logs) with a **RunID**.
