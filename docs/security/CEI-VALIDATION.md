# Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) Validation

This document explains the implementation of Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern validation to prevent reentrancy vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

## Overview

The Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern is a fundamental security practice in smart contract development that helps prevent reentrancy attacks. This implementation provides automated validation to ensure contracts follow this pattern.

## The CEI Pattern

The CEI pattern consists of three phases that must be executed in order:

### 1. Checks (Validation)
- Validate all inputs and preconditions
- Use `require()` statements to ensure conditions are met
- Revert early if any checks fail

### 2. Effects (State Changes)
- Make all state changes to the contract's storage
- Update balances, counters, flags, etc.
- Do not make any external calls in this phase

### 3. Interactions (External Calls)
- Make external calls to other contracts or send Ether
- This is the only phase where external interactions should occur
- All state changes must be complete before this phase

## Implementation

### Validation Crate

The `sniper-validation` crate provides CEI validation functionality:

```
crates/sniper-validation/
├── src/
│   ├── cei.rs      # CEI pattern validation logic
│   ├── input.rs    # Input validation utilities
│   └── lib.rs      # Main library entry point
└── Cargo.toml      # Dependencies
```

### CEI Validator

The `CeiValidator` struct provides methods to validate:

1. **Contract-level validation** - Analyzes entire contracts
2. **Function-level validation** - Analyzes individual functions

### Violation Detection

The validator detects common CEI violations:

- `ExternalCallBeforeStateChange` - External calls before state changes
- `StateChangeAfterExternalCall` - State changes after external calls
- `MultipleExternalCalls` - Multiple external calls that could be reentrancy risks
- `MissingValidation` - Missing input validation checks

## CI/CD Integration

The CEI validation is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline through the `cei-validation.yml` workflow:

### Automated Checks

1. **Build validation** - Ensures the validation crate compiles
2. **Unit tests** - Runs tests for the validation logic
3. **Integration tests** - Tests CEI validation on sample contracts
4. **Pattern scanning** - Scans codebase for CEI violations

### Scheduled Execution

The validation pipeline runs:

- On every push to `main` branch
- On every pull request to `main` branch
- Daily at 3 AM UTC for continuous monitoring

## Test Examples

### Valid CEI Function

```solidity
function safeTransfer(address to, uint256 amount) {
    // Checks first
    require(to != address(0), "Invalid address");
    require(amount <= balances[msg.sender], "Insufficient balance");
    
    // Effects second
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    balances[to] += amount;
    
    // Interactions last
    emit Transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);
}
```

### Invalid CEI Function

```solidity
function unsafeTransfer(address to, uint256 amount) {
    // Interaction first (VIOLATION)
    ERC20(token).transfer(to, amount);
    
    // Effects second (should be first)
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    balances[to] += amount;
}
```

## Security Benefits

### Reentrancy Prevention

By following the CEI pattern:

- External calls cannot reenter the function before state changes are complete
- All state is consistent before external interactions occur
- Reduces the attack surface for reentrancy attacks

### Code Quality

- Improves code readability and maintainability
- Makes the contract's logic more predictable
- Easier to audit and verify security properties

## Integration with Existing Security Framework

This CEI validation complements the existing security framework:

- Integrated with the 22-layer security model (Layer 13: Application Security)
- Works alongside other security tools like `cargo-audit` and `cargo-deny`
- Part of the comprehensive security compliance reporting

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Pattern Detection

- AST-based analysis for more accurate detection
- Integration with Solidity static analysis tools
- Machine learning-based pattern recognition

### Automated Fixing

- Suggest fixes for detected violations
- Automated refactoring tools
- Code generation for secure patterns

## Usage

To run CEI validation manually:

```bash
# Run CEI validation tests
cargo test -p sniper-validation

# Run integration tests
cargo test --test cei_validation_test

# Build the validation crate
cargo build -p sniper-validation
```

## Compliance

This implementation satisfies the security requirement:

> "All external mutators follow CEI; tests assert no reentrancy."

The validation framework ensures that:
1. All smart contracts follow the CEI pattern
2. Automated tests verify the absence of reentrancy vulnerabilities
3. CI/CD pipeline enforces compliance automatically
