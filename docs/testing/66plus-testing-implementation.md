2. **Scheduled Runs**: Full test suite runs daily
3. **On-demand Execution**: Manual trigger with category selection
4. **Comprehensive Reporting**: Summary of executed tests
5. **Parallel Execution**: Independent test categories run in parallel

### Test Execution Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test --workspace

# Run specific test category
cargo test --test "unit"
cargo test --test "integration"

# Run with coverage
cargo tarpaulin --verbose

# Static analysis
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings

# Security scanning
cargo audit
cargo deny check bans sources licenses
```
