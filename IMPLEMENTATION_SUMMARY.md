- **Service Modes**: 
  - Normal mode (real trade execution)
  - Shadow mode (virtual trade simulation)
  - Observe-only mode (signal observation without action)
- **Environment Configuration**: Configurable via STRATEGY_MODE environment variable

### 4. Operations & Governance

#### Operational Runbooks
Created comprehensive operational documentation:

1. **General Operations README** - Overview of system components and procedures
2. **Deployment Runbook** - Detailed deployment procedures and rollback processes
3. **Incident Response Runbook** - Comprehensive incident handling procedures
4. **Security Procedures Runbook** - Security policies and procedures
5. **Monitoring & Alerting Runbook** - Monitoring setup and alert management

#### Key Documentation Areas
- **System Overview**: Architecture and component descriptions
