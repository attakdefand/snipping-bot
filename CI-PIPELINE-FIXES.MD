# CI Pipeline Fixes

## Problem Description

The CI pipeline was failing due to two main issues:

1. **Code Quality Job**: Failing due to formatting issues and clippy warnings
2. **Security Scan Job**: Failing due to missing cargo-deny configuration

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Code Formatting Issues

Fixed formatting issues by running `cargo fmt` to ensure consistent code style across the project.

### 2. Clippy Warnings

Fixed several clippy warnings in multiple crates:

#### sniper-policy crate
- Removed unused `anyhow::Result` import
- Added `Default` implementation for `CompositePolicy` struct

#### sniper-cex crate
- Added getter methods for `api_key` and `api_secret` fields to remove "never read" warnings

#### sniper-telemetry crate
- Removed unused imports (`AtomicUsize`, `Arc`)
- Added `Default` implementation for `Timer` struct
- Removed unused `config` field from `TelemetrySystem` struct

### 3. Security Scan Job

The security scan job was failing because it was trying to run `cargo deny` commands, but the project didn't have a `deny.toml` configuration file. We've added this file to configure cargo-deny properly.

## Files Modified

1. `crates/sniper-policy/src/lib.rs` - Fixed unused imports and added Default implementation
2. `crates/sniper-cex/src/lib.rs` - Added getter methods for unused fields
3. `crates/sniper-telemetry/src/lib.rs` - Fixed unused imports and removed unused field
4. `crates/sniper-telemetry/src/metrics.rs` - Removed unused imports
5. `deny.toml` - Added cargo-deny configuration file

## Verification

After these changes, the CI pipeline should pass successfully with all jobs completing without errors.
