# Branching Strategy and Security Framework

This document outlines the recommended branching strategy and security/code quality framework for the Sniper Bot trading system.

## Branching Strategy

### Core Branches

#### 1. main (Production)
- **Purpose**: Production-ready code only
- **Protection**: Branch protection with required reviews
- **Deployment**: Automatically deployed to production environment
- **Merge Criteria**: 
  - All tests must pass
  - Security scans must pass
  - Code review by at least 2 senior developers
  - Performance benchmarks must meet requirements

#### 2. develop (Development)
- **Purpose**: Main integration branch for ongoing development
- **Protection**: Branch protection with required CI checks
- **Deployment**: Deployed to development environment
- **Merge Criteria**:
  - All unit tests must pass
  - Code review by at least 1 developer
  - No critical security issues

#### 3. staging (Pre-production)
- **Purpose**: Pre-production testing environment
- **Protection**: Branch protection with comprehensive checks
- **Deployment**: Deployed to staging environment
- **Merge Criteria**:
  - All tests must pass
  - Security scans must pass
  - Performance benchmarks must meet requirements
  - Manual QA approval

### Feature Branches

#### 4. feature/* (Feature Development)
- **Pattern**: `feature/[descriptive-name]`
- **Examples**: 
  - `feature/wasm-dashboard-enhancements`
  - `feature/ml-model-integration`
  - `feature/risk-engine-improvements`
- **Purpose**: Isolated feature development
- **Lifecycle**: Branch from `develop`, merge back to `develop`
- **Protection**: None (individual developer branches)

#### 5. bugfix/* (Bug Fixes)
- **Pattern**: `bugfix/[issue-number]-[descriptive-name]`
- **Purpose**: Fixing non-critical bugs
- **Lifecycle**: Branch from `develop`, merge back to `develop`
- **Protection**: None

#### 6. hotfix/* (Urgent Production Fixes)
- **Pattern**: `hotfix/[issue-number]-[descriptive-name]`
- **Purpose**: Urgent production fixes
- **Lifecycle**: Branch from `main`, merge to both `main` and `develop`
- **Protection**: Branch protection with required reviews

#### 7. release/* (Release Preparation)
- **Pattern**: `release/v[version-number]`
- **Purpose**: Preparing for a new release
- **Lifecycle**: Branch from `develop`, merge to both `main` and `develop`
- **Protection**: Branch protection with comprehensive checks

### Specialized Branches (Trading Bot Specific)

#### 8. backtesting
- **Purpose**: Dedicated branch for backtesting improvements
- **Usage**: For developing and testing new backtesting features
- **Integration**: Regular merges to `develop`

#### 9. security
- **Purpose**: Dedicated branch for security enhancements
- **Usage**: For implementing security improvements and fixes
- **Integration**: Regular merges to `develop` after security review

#### 10. compliance
- **Purpose**: For compliance-related changes
- **Usage**: For implementing compliance requirements
- **Integration**: Regular merges to `develop` after compliance review

## Security Framework

### Automated Security Checks

#### 1. Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- **Tool**: cargo-audit, cargo-deny
- **Frequency**: On every push and pull request
- **Scope**: 
  - Dependency vulnerability scanning
  - Code pattern analysis
  - Security anti-pattern detection

#### 2. Secret Scanning
- **Tool**: Git-secrets, GitHub Advanced Security
- **Frequency**: On every push
- **Scope**: 
  - Prevent API keys, passwords in code
  - Detect hardcoded secrets
  - Scan for sensitive data exposure

#### 3. Dependency Scanning
- **Tool**: cargo-audit, Dependabot
- **Frequency**: Daily scans
- **Scope**:
  - Known vulnerabilities in dependencies
  - Outdated dependencies
  - License compliance

#### 4. Container Security (If using Docker)
- **Tool**: Clair, Trivy
- **Frequency**: On container image build
- **Scope**:
  - Base image vulnerabilities
  - Runtime security issues
  - Configuration best practices

### Security Best Practices

#### 1. Key Management
- **Implementation**: Use existing `sniper-keys` crate
- **Validation**: Regular audits using security framework
- **Storage**: HSM or Vault integration
- **Rotation**: Automated key rotation policies

#### 2. Compliance Verification
- **Tool**: `scripts/run_compliance_tests.ps1`
- **Frequency**: On every release
- **Scope**:
  - DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.MD adherence
  - Security policy compliance
  - Risk management protocol validation

#### 3. Risk Controls
- **Implementation**: Use existing `sniper-risk` crate
- **Validation**: Continuous monitoring
- **Testing**: Regular risk scenario testing

## Code Quality Framework

### Pre-commit Hooks

#### 1. Code Formatting
- **Tool**: rustfmt
- **Enforcement**: Required on all commits
- **Configuration**: Standard Rust formatting

#### 2. Linting
- **Tool**: clippy
- **Enforcement**: Required on all commits
- **Configuration**: Deny warnings, enforce best practices

#### 3. Unit Tests
- **Tool**: cargo test
- **Enforcement**: Required on all commits
- **Coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage

#### 4. Documentation
- **Tool**: rustdoc
- **Enforcement**: Required on public APIs
- **Validation**: Documentation generation

### Continuous Integration

#### 1. Automated Testing
- **Scope**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- **Tools**: cargo test, custom test frameworks
- **Frequency**: On every push and pull request
- **Reporting**: Test results posted to PR

#### 2. Code Coverage
- **Tool**: tarpaulin or similar
- **Requirement**: Minimum 80% coverage
- **Reporting**: Coverage reports generated

#### 3. Performance Benchmarking
- **Tool**: Built-in benchmarking framework
- **Frequency**: On release branches
- **Validation**: Performance regression checks

#### 4. Integration Testing
- **Scope**: Cross-service integration tests
- **Tools**: Custom integration test framework
- **Frequency**: On staging deployments

## Implementation Recommendations

### GitHub Actions Workflows

1. **CI Pipeline**:
   - Run on every push to any branch
   - Execute formatting, linting, and unit tests
   - Post results to PR

2. **Security Scanning**:
   - Run on every push to main/develop
   - Execute cargo-audit and dependency scans
   - Block merges on critical vulnerabilities

3. **Release Pipeline**:
   - Run on release/* branches
   - Execute comprehensive test suite
   - Generate release artifacts
   - Update documentation

### Branch Protection Rules

1. **main**:
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Require status checks to pass
   - Require branches to be up to date

2. **develop**:
   - Require status checks to pass
   - Require linear history

3. **staging**:
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Require status checks to pass

### Monitoring and Alerts

1. **Security Alerts**:
   - Email notifications for critical vulnerabilities
   - Slack notifications for security incidents

2. **Code Quality Alerts**:
   - PR comments for code quality issues
   - Weekly code quality reports

3. **Performance Alerts**:
   - Performance regression notifications
   - Resource usage alerts

## Conclusion

This branching strategy and security framework provides a solid foundation for developing, testing, and deploying the Sniper Bot trading system securely and with high code quality. The approach balances development agility with security and quality requirements specific to financial trading systems.
