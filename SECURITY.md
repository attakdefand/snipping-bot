## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it by emailing security@sniper-bot.org. Please do not create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously and will respond within 48 hours. If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon as possible, typically within 7 days.

Please include the following information in your report:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any possible mitigations you've identified

## Security Practices

### Key Management
- All cryptographic keys are managed through the `sniper-keys` crate
- Keys are never hardcoded in source code
- Hardware Security Modules (HSM) or Vault integration is used for production
- Regular key rotation policies are enforced

### Code Security
- All code undergoes security review before merging
- Automated security scanning is performed on every commit
- Dependencies are regularly audited for vulnerabilities
- Security best practices are enforced through CI/CD

### Risk Management
- Real-time risk management through the `sniper-risk` crate
- Compliance enforcement through the `sniper-policy` crate
- Regular risk assessment and mitigation
- Backtesting and simulation for risk validation

### Compliance
- Adherence to DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.MD
- Regular compliance verification using `scripts/run_compliance_tests.ps1`
- Documentation of all security and compliance measures
- Regular security training for developers

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for all security-critical components
- Integration tests for security workflows
- Fuzz testing for critical input handling
- Penetration testing for external interfaces

### Manual Testing
- Security code reviews for all changes
- Architecture reviews for new features
- Third-party security audits for major releases
- Red team exercises for critical components

## Incident Response

In the event of a security incident:
1. Containment - Isolate affected systems
2. Investigation - Determine scope and impact
3. Remediation - Apply fixes and patches
4. Communication - Notify stakeholders as appropriate
5. Documentation - Record incident and lessons learned

## Dependencies

We use cargo-audit and cargo-deny to monitor dependencies for known vulnerabilities. All dependencies are regularly updated through Dependabot.

## Code Review Process

All code changes must be reviewed by at least one other developer before merging. Security-sensitive changes require review by a security team member.

## Branch Protection

The main branch has the following protections:
- Required code reviews
- Required status checks (including security checks)
- Required linear history
- Required signed commits (for releases)
