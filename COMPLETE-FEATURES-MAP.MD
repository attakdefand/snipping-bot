awesome—here’s a clean, “complete-features” breakdown of your guide, organized exactly as you asked: **main types → sub types → components**. i’ve mapped it to a Rust, microservice-y sniper stack (e.g., `sniper-keys`, `sniper-risk`, `sniper-strategy`, `sniper-exec`, `sniper-sim`, `sniper-telemetry`, etc.), with promotion gates, KPIs, and copy-pasteable checklists.

## Test Suite Blueprint (quick)

* **Unit (risk/position)**: boundary tests; property tests (no overflow, monotonic limits)
* **Integration (e2e)**: signal→risk→exec→ledger; idempotency; partial failures
* **Security**: secret leakage tests, mTLS negative, authz matrix, pen test hooks
* **Performance**: p50/p95 latency under x N msg/s; soak 24–48h; chaos (packet loss, restart)
* **Acceptance Gates**: see promotion gates in each phase

## KPIs / SLOs You Can Track From Day 1

* Strategy: win rate, PF ≥ 1.2, Sharpe ≥ 1.0, avg win/avg loss ≥ 1.2
* Risk: max DD within policy; cap breaches = 0; VaR/ES trend stable
* Execution: decision p95 ≤ 150 ms; ack p95 ≤ 300 ms; reject ≤ 1%
* Reliability: >99.5% availability; error budget burn alarms
* Integrity: audit log completeness 100%; config change review 2-eyes

## “One-Pager” Runbook Links (suggested files)

* `RUNBOOKS/kill_switch.md` — when/how to hard-stop
* `RUNBOOKS/withdraw_funds.md` — step-by-step, per venue
* `RUNBOOKS/incident_template.md` — timeline, impact, actions, follow-ups
* `CHECKLISTS/pre_flight.md` / `post_flight.md`
* `SECURITY/controls_matrix.md` — mTLS/RBAC/Vault mappings
* `COMPLIANCE/requirements.md` — venue/jurisdiction matrix

### Final Notes

* Keep your **promotion gates** quantitative and automated (CI step that refuses deployment unless KPIs are met).
* Treat **sim → small capital → scale** as **separate releases** with their own changelogs and rollback plans.
* Log **everything** (decisions, intents, checks, fills) with IDs to reconcile sim vs live 1:1.

If you want, I can turn this into a **scaffolded folder set** (configs, runbooks, policy, tests) with placeholder files you can drop straight into your repo.
