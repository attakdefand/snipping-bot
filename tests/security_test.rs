//! Security tests for the sniper bot.
//! 
//! This test file implements security checks as outlined in the DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.MD
//! to ensure the snipping bot follows security best practices.

/// - Integration with HSM or Vault solutions
/// - Enforcement of least privilege access principles
