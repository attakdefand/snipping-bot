Nice — let’s build a safe, practical playbook so you can enter a DEX and attempt to buy a token with a sniper/snipping bot. I’ll give: (A) step-by-step runbook you can follow, (B) complete feature map (components, main types, subtypes), (C) risk controls / testing checklist, and (D) a compact pseudo-flow you can adapt into your Rust bot. No background tasks — everything here is actionable now.

# TL;DR

1. **Paper-trade first.** Validate strategy in simulation.
2. **Prepare a safe wallet** (small hot wallet + hardware cold for savings).
3. **Watch the token launch** (mempool / liquidity add event).
4. **Validate liquidity & router path** (check initial pool tokens & amounts).
5. **Send a crafted buy tx** with correct gas, slippage, and deadline.
6. **Monitor TX** and fallback (re-estimate, replace-by-fee, cancel if stuck).
7. **Post-trade**: check contract for honeypot (transfer restrictions), withdraw or hold.

---

# A. Step-by-step runbook — from zero to buy

## 1) Preflight (safety + setup)

1. Create two wallets:

   * **Hot wallet**: small funds used for snipes (funds you can lose).
   * **Backup/cold**: hardware wallet for long term funds.
2. Node/RPC:

   * Use a reliable RPC provider (quick, low latency). Have at least 2 providers as fallback.
3. Fund the hot wallet with native chain token for gas (e.g., ETH, BNB, AVAX) and a small stablecoin if needed.
4. Install and test signing flow locally (or use a secure HSM/MPC). Never hardcode private keys in public repos.
5. Paper trading environment: start by simulating the exact chain flow (forked chain like `anvil`/`hardhat`/Ganache). Validate end-to-end.

## 2) Watching for the target event

1. Decide snipe trigger:

   * **Liquidity add** to a pair (common for new token launches).
   * **Token list event / announcement** (less reliable).
2. Watch methods:

   * **Mempool watcher / pending pool** for the addLiquidity tx or pair creation tx.
   * **On-chain scanner**: check factory contract for `PairCreated` events.
   * **RPC subscribe** or an archive node with websockets.

## 3) Pre-trade checks (must pass)

1. **Confirm pair** exists and is the intended token address. Avoid tokens impersonating (check full contract address).
2. **Liquidity depth**: compute min price impact for your buy amount (use pool reserves). If tiny liquidity, price will spike huge.
3. **Ownership & renounce**: check if token contract owner can mint/blacklist or change fees.
4. **Honeypot check**: try a tiny transfer out test (or analyze contract for `transfer`/`_beforeTokenTransfer` restrictions).
5. **Tax/fees**: read token for transfer tax or fees that substract from the received tokens.
6. **Slippage tolerance**: set to tolerable level (e.g., 1–3% for big pools; more for thin pools but higher risk).

## 4) Constructing the buy transaction

1. Choose router call:

   * `swapExactETHForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens` or `swapExactTokensForTokens` depending on token.
2. Compute:

   * `amountIn` (native token you spend), `minAmountOut` (slippage adjusted), `deadline`.
3. Gas strategy:

   * Estimate base gas; set gas price / priority fee competitively.
   * Optionally use EIP-1559 base + maxPriorityFee higher for faster inclusion.
4. Use `replace-by-fee` (RBF) if network supports it to speed if pending.

## 5) Submit & monitor

1. Broadcast tx; watch mempool + block inclusion.
2. If tx fails due to slippage or out-of-gas, handle programmatically: re-estimate and re-send or abort.
3. After success, attempt to transfer a small test amount out if worried about honeypot.

## 6) Post-trade: risk & exit

1. **Set sell rules** (target price / trailing stop / manual exit).
2. **Beware front-running / sandwich attacks**: large buy may be sandwiched. Consider fragmentation or using private tx relays (Flashbots-style, where available and legal).
3. **Record TX evidence** (hash, block, gas used) for audits.

---

# B. Complete features: main types, subtypes & components (architecture for a production-grade sniping bot)

## 1. High-level system layers

1. **Data & Watchers**

   * *Blockchain Listener*: websocket/RPC mempool subscriber.
   * *Event Parser*: decode factory/pair events, liquidity adds.
   * *Price & Liquidity Oracle*: compute virtual price; reserve reading.
2. **Strategy Core**

   * *Trigger Engine*: event → candidate decision.
   * *Entry Strategy*: buy size calc, slippage model, fragmentation plan.
   * *Exit Strategy*: profit target, stop loss, trailing, time-based exit.
3. **Execution Engine**

   * *Signer*: secure key management (software signer, HSM, MPC).
   * *Tx Builder*: route selection, calldata builder.
   * *Gas Manager*: dynamic gas estimation, RBF strategy.
   * *Private Relay* (optional): use private relay/MEV relayers for front-run protection.
4. **Risk & Safety**

   * *Honeypot Detector*: static analysis + tiny transfer tests.
   * *Sanity Checks*: ownership renounce, mint functions, blacklist checks.
   * *Rate Limiter*: avoid accidental mass orders.
   * *Kill Switch*: immediate stop and burn for emergencies.
5. **Telemetry & Ops**

   * *Logger*: structured logs (tx hash, gas, outcome).
   * *Metrics*: p90 latency, success rate, gas burn.
   * *Dashboard*: real-time state, alerts.
   * *Alerting*: Telegram/Slack + oncall notifications.
6. **Environment & CI**

   * *Simulator*: forked network testing.
   * *Backtester*: historical replay and slippage modeling.
   * *CI*: lint, unit tests, integration tests for contract interactions.

## 2. Component breakdown (modules)

* **Watcher**

  * RPC clients, websocket handlers, mempool inspector
* **Analyzer**

  * Pair discovery, reserve calculator, implied price estimators
* **Strategy**

  * Buy signal generator, fragmentation planner, risk policy enforcer
* **Executor**

  * Router adapter, tx signer, gas strategy, RBF controller
* **Validator**

  * Token contract static analyzer (AST/bytecode heuristics), dynamic behavioral tests
* **Store**

  * Local DB (SQLite/Postgres) for events, trades, and logs
* **UI/API**

  * REST/WebSocket UI for manual overrides, dashboards, and historical views
* **Security**

  * Secrets store (Vault or OS keyring), secrets rotation, access audit

## 3. Strategy types (main types + subtypes)

1. **Pure Snipe** — single trade right after liquidity add.

   * Subtypes: full-size snipe, split snipe (multiple fragments)
2. **Mempool Snipe** — detect pending liquidity tx and pre-empt or follow immediately.
3. **MEV Protected Snipe** — submit via private relays to avoid being sandwiched.
4. **Auto-Avalanche** — multiple buys across DEXes to arbitrage price differences.
5. **Liquidity Snatch + Quick Exit** — small buy + fast sell to profit from tiny pumps.
6. **Hold & Play** — snipe and hold for long-term gain with automated exit rules.

---

# C. Risk controls & testing checklist (must have)

1. **Paper Trade** on forked mainnet for every strategy change.
2. **Unit tests** for math (slippage, reserve math) — arithmetic must be exact.
3. **Simulate network latency & gas volatility** in CI.
4. **Contract static security scan** (OpenZeppelin, Slither-like checks).
5. **Honeypot test**: small transfer out test or pre-check code paths before large buys.
6. **Rate limit** buys per minute/day; set maximum daily exposure.
7. **Auto kill-switch**: if losses exceed X% or suspicious behavior detected.
8. **Auditable logs** for every tx attempt and rationale.
9. **Secrets management**: never push private keys into repo. Use Vault or env encrypted stores.
10. **Manual override UI** to stop trading instantly.

---

# D. Compact pseudoflow (one-page) — adapt into Rust modules

1. `Watcher`:

   * Subscribe factory/pair events (ws). On `PairCreated` or `AddLiquidity` → push to candidate queue.
2. `Analyzer`:

   * Read reserves: `reserve0`, `reserve1` → compute implied price.
   * Check liquidity threshold: if `reserveToken` < minimum → skip.
   * Check token code: owner calls, mint, fees, blacklist functions (quick bytecode scan).
3. `Strategy`:

   * Decide `amountIn = min(hot_balance * exposure_pct, maxSingleBuy)`.
   * `minAmountOut = quote(amountIn) * (1 - slippage_pct)`.
   * Build route: `[WETH -> Token]` or multi-hop if needed.
4. `Validator`:

   * Optional: broadcast tiny test transfer (0.001 native) to token to validate transfers out allowed.
5. `Executor`:

   * Build calldata for `swapExactETHForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens(minAmountOut, path, to, deadline)`.
   * Gas: `estimated + safety_margin`; set `maxPriorityFee` to beat mempool.
   * Sign tx using secure signer.
   * Broadcast; monitor pending → on success record; on revert analyze reason.
6. `Post`:

   * If buy success: run honeypot transfer-out test or attempt to list on dashboard for sell targets.

> Note: In Rust, split modules: `watcher`, `analyzer`, `strategy`, `executor`, `store`, `telemetry`. Use `tokio` for async, `ethers-rs` for Ethereum interactions, `sqlx` or `rusqlite` for DB, `prometheus` client for metrics.

---

# E. Practical operational tips & anti-pitfalls

* **Start very small**: first real runs with tiny amounts. You’ll inevitably lose at start.
* **Avoid scams**: tokens with `onlyOwner` mint functions or `blacklist` are extremely risky.
* **Sandwich risk**: large visible buys get sandwich-attacked; consider private relays or fragment buys.
* **Gas wars**: bidding higher gas sometimes burns too much profit — model expected profit vs gas cost.
* **Slippage traps**: token taxes or transfer fees will reduce received tokens — use fee-aware router calls.
* **Legal & ethical**: check local/regional regulations re: market manipulation and MEV usage.

---

# F. Minimal checklist before any live snipe

* Wallet funded (native gas + small stable).
* RPC health: <1000 ms latency, 99% uptime.
* Simulator replayed the trade scenario 3× successfully.
* Honeypot check passed.
* Slippage & fee parameters set.
* Kill-switch and manual stop ready.
* Logging & alerting connected (Telegram/Slack).

---

# Want a starting template?

If you want, I can immediately generate:

* A Rust module skeleton (workspace Cargo.toml + `watcher`, `strategy`, `executor` crates) using `ethers-rs` and `tokio`.
* A simulation script to run on a forked chain (Anvil/hardhat) and example configuration (`config.toml`) for slippage, exposure, gas strategy.

Do you want that Rust skeleton and a short simulation runbook next? (If yes I’ll produce code you can paste and run locally — secure-key placeholders only.)

Excellent follow-up 👏 — let’s map that clearly.
According to the **guide and architecture above**, the number of DEXs you can safely and effectively enter with your **sniping bot** depends on how you scale along three axes:

---

## ⚙️ 1. Structural Limit — “How many DEXes your bot can *technically* handle”

| Layer                      | Description                                                                          | How many you can join                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **RPC/Node Layer**         | Each chain (Ethereum, BSC, Arbitrum, etc.) needs its own RPC endpoint and websocket. | ✅ *Unlimited in theory*, but realistically **4–6 active chains** before you hit latency & bandwidth limits.                                          |
| **Watcher/Listener Layer** | Each DEX requires a separate listener for `PairCreated` / `AddLiquidity` events.     | ✅ You can safely run **10–20 concurrent DEX listeners** (e.g., PancakeSwap, UniV2, Sushi, TraderJoe, etc.) using async Rust (`tokio` + `ethers-rs`). |
| **Strategy Engine**        | Each DEX may need its own slippage, router path, and gas model.                      | ✅ Typically **5–10 DEX configs** before configuration complexity explodes (keep them in TOML/YAML per DEX).                                          |
| **Execution Layer**        | One executor per chain is enough (it routes calls to the right DEX).                 | ✅ One per chain (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, etc.) is best practice.                                                                                     |

## 🌐 2. Realistic Operational Range (recommended by the guideline)

| Tier                                       | DEX count | Chains     | Description                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧪 **Level 1 – Experimental**              | 1–2 DEX   | 1 chain    | Start here (e.g., PancakeSwap on BSC + Uniswap on Ethereum). Simulate and confirm latency.                                                               |
| ⚡ **Level 2 – Multi-DEX, Single-Chain**    | 3–5 DEX   | 1 chain    | Add SushiSwap, BabySwap, DODO, Biswap. Run concurrent watchers with one execution queue.                                                                 |
| 🌍 **Level 3 – Multi-Chain Parallel**      | 6–10 DEX  | 3–4 chains | Add TraderJoe (AVAX), QuickSwap (Polygon), SpiritSwap (Fantom). Use multi-RPC and async pipelines.                                                       |
| 🧭 **Level 4 – Cross-Ecosystem Arbitrage** | 10–20 DEX | 4–6 chains | Advanced bot using shared liquidity data to cross-route trades. Needs orchestration, rate-limiters, and telemetry cluster.                               |
| 🛰️ **Level 5 – Global Sniper Grid**       | 20+ DEX   | 6+ chains  | Requires distributed agents (microservices or multiple servers). Needs central control plane for risk, wallet mgmt, and metrics. Only for mature setups. |

## 🧩 3. Types of DEXes you can integrate

Let’s classify by main type → subtypes → examples:

| **Main Type**                    | **Sub-Types**                    | **Example DEXs**                           | **Key Component**                     |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| **AMM (Constant Product)**       | V2 style, fee-on-transfer        | UniswapV2, PancakeSwap, SushiSwap, ApeSwap | `swapExactETHForTokens`               |
| **AMM (Concentrated Liquidity)** | CLAMM                            | UniswapV3, Algebra, PancakeV3              | Range orders, NFT liquidity positions |
| **Curve-style Stable AMM**       | Stableswap                       | Curve, Ellipsis                            | `add_liquidity`, `exchange`           |
| **Aggregator DEX**               | Router across others             | 1inch, OpenOcean, Paraswap                 | Multi-route optimizer                 |
| **Orderbook DEX**                | On-chain limit orders            | Serum, dYdX, Injective                     | Matching engine style                 |
| **Hybrid DEX (AMM + Orderbook)** | Off-chain order, on-chain settle | CowSwap, Loopring                          | Intent settlement                     |
| **Launchpad / Presale**          | Token sniping target             | PinkSale, DxSale                           | Requires special contract trigger     |
| **Bridge/Swap Hub**              | Multi-chain swap                 | SushiXSwap, Stargate                       | Cross-chain relays                    |
| **Custom Router DEX**            | Meme/Custom tokens               | BabyDogeSwap, ShibaSwap                    | Use fee-aware router call             |
| **Private DEX (MEV-protected)**  | Relay-only                       | Flashbots, Eden, CoW relays                | Protected transaction submission      |

---

## 🛠️ 4. Component scaling rules

| Component           | Scaling Behavior                                   | Safe Limit                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Watcher Threads** | Each DEX adds one websocket + 1-2 async tasks.     | Up to 20 concurrent if CPU ≥ 8 cores. |
| **Mempool Parser**  | Shared among DEXes on same chain.                  | 1 per chain.                          |
| **Executor Queue**  | Multi-DEX shared queue with back-pressure control. | 1 per chain, unlimited routes.        |
| **Telemetry DB**    | Logs all trades; scale Postgres/ClickHouse.        | Scales horizontally.                  |
| **Config Registry** | `configs/<chain>/<dex>.toml` per DEX.              | Scales to hundreds.                   |

---

## 🔒 5. Practical limits from security/risk guidelines

Even though you *can* enter many, you **should cap active DEX targets** to:

| Risk Level          | Max Active DEXs | Reason                                                                                              |
| ------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Safe / Beginner     | **≤ 3**         | You can track each manually; low key risk.                                                          |
| Intermediate        | **≤ 7**         | Multi-chain async starts needing monitoring + alerting.                                             |
| Expert              | **≤ 15–20**     | Needs watchdog, alert, and rollback.                                                                |
| Global Botnet-style | 20+             | Requires orchestrated cluster + automated key management (Vault, MPC). Only for institutional bots. |

---

## 🧠 6. Strategy multiplexing per DEX

Each DEX can host multiple **strategy sub-modules**:

| Strategy                | Description                         | DEX Coverage                        |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Liquidity Snipe**     | Detect first `AddLiquidity` → buy.  | All AMM-style DEXes                 |
| **Mempool Follow**      | Mirror liquidity tx in mempool.     | DEXs with transparent mempool (EVM) |
| **Cross-DEX Arbitrage** | Compare price across DEXs.          | Multi-DEX same chain                |
| **Bridge Arbitrage**    | Cross-chain same token.             | DEXs on multiple chains             |
| **Rebase Catcher**      | Monitor tokens with rebasing logic. | Curve, Balancer, others             |
| **Launchpad Hook**      | Monitor presale → post-listing buy. | PinkSale, DxSale                    |
| **Quick Exit Bot**      | Auto-sell after N% profit.          | All liquid pools                    |

You can run **multiple strategies across 10+ DEXes** concurrently if your architecture uses:

* `tokio::task` concurrency
* Async queue like `tokio::mpsc`
* Central `State` struct to track open trades per DEX

## 🧭 Summary — According to the guide, you can enter:

| Category                          | How many DEXs you can handle safely |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |

Would you like me to generate a **Rust configuration layout** (one `dex_config.toml` per DEX) showing how to register all 10 of these exchanges into your sniping bot system (with RPC URLs, routers, and event signatures)?
That will let your bot auto-discover and enter any DEX listed above.
