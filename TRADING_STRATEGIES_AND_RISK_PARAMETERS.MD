# Trading Strategies and Risk Parameters Guide

This guide explains the trading strategies and risk parameters available in the snipping bot, with examples and configuration instructions.

## Trading Strategies

### 1. Launch Sniping Strategy

Launch sniping is one of the most popular strategies in the crypto space. It involves detecting new token launches and executing trades immediately.

#### Key Components:
- **Signal Detection**: Monitors for new pair creations on DEXs
- **Token Quality Filters**: Checks for honeypots and scams
- **Liquidity Requirements**: Ensures sufficient liquidity
- **Execution Timing**: Optimizes gas prices and timing

#### Example Configuration (`comprehensive_launch_snipe.toml`):
```toml
[strategy]
name = "Comprehensive Launch Snipe"
enabled = true

[strategy.trading]
chains = ["ethereum", "bsc", "polygon"]
max_concurrent_trades = 5
position_size_percent = 2.0
min_liquidity_usd = 10000

[strategy.sniping]
delay_ms = 100
gas_price_multiplier = 1.2
max_slippage_percent = 3.0

[strategy.exits]
take_profit_percent = 50.0
stop_loss_percent = 20.0
trailing_stop_percent = 10.0
```

### 2. Arbitrage Strategy

Arbitrage strategies exploit price differences between different venues (DEXs, CEXs, NFT markets).

#### Key Components:
- **Price Monitoring**: Tracks prices across multiple venues
- **Profit Calculation**: Accounts for fees and slippage
- **Execution Speed**: Requires fast execution to capture opportunities
- **Route Optimization**: Finds the most profitable execution paths

#### Example Configuration (`arbitrage_strategy.toml`):
```toml
[strategy]
name = "Cross-Venue Arbitrage"
enabled = true

[strategy.trading]
chains = ["ethereum", "bsc"]
max_concurrent_trades = 10
position_size_percent = 1.5

[strategy.arbitrage]
min_profit_threshold_percent = 1.5
max_slippage_percent = 1.0
execution_timeout_seconds = 10

[strategy.exits]
take_profit_percent = 3.0
stop_loss_percent = 1.0
```

### 3. Other Available Strategies

The bot includes several other pre-configured strategies:
- **Liquidity Addition**: Trades when liquidity is added to pools
- **Price Threshold**: Executes trades when price changes exceed thresholds
- **NFT Mint**: Participates in NFT collection mints
- **NFT Listing**: Trades NFTs when they're listed on marketplaces
- **IDO Claim**: Participates in Initial DEX Offerings
- **Airdrop Claim**: Claims airdropped tokens

## Risk Parameters

Risk management is crucial for long-term profitability. The bot provides comprehensive risk controls at multiple levels.

### 1. Portfolio-Level Risk Controls

These controls manage overall portfolio exposure:

```toml
[portfolio]
max_daily_loss_percent = 3.0
max_weekly_loss_percent = 8.0
max_portfolio_exposure_percent = 25.0
max_concurrent_positions = 15
```

### 2. Position-Level Risk Controls

These controls manage individual trade risks:

```toml
[position]
max_position_loss_percent = 10.0
max_position_size_percent = 5.0
min_position_size_usd = 100
```

### 3. Trading Safety Checks

These checks prevent common trading pitfalls:

```toml
[honeypot]
sell_test_enabled = true
ownership_check = true
mint_function_check = true
max_ownership_percent = 10.0
```

### 4. Exit Strategy Controls

Proper exit strategies are essential for locking in profits and limiting losses:

```toml
[stop_loss]
default_stop_loss_percent = 10.0
trailing_stop_enabled = true
trailing_stop_percent = 5.0

[take_profit]
default_take_profit_percent = 30.0
partial_take_profit_percent = 15.0
```

## Using the Configuration Script

We've provided a PowerShell script to help you manage configurations:

```bash
# List all available strategies and risk configurations
./scripts/configure-trading.ps1

# List only strategies
./scripts/configure-trading.ps1 -ConfigType strategies

# List only risk configurations
./scripts/configure-trading.ps1 -ConfigType risks

# Apply a risk configuration
./scripts/configure-trading.ps1 -ConfigType apply-risk -Name risk_simple.toml
```

## Best Practices

### For Beginners:
1. Start with `risk_simple.toml` for basic risk controls
2. Use simple strategies like `launch_snipe.toml`
3. Start with small position sizes (1-2% of capital)
4. Monitor trades closely and adjust parameters gradually

### For Advanced Users:
1. Use `risk_comprehensive.toml` for advanced risk controls
2. Create custom strategies based on `example_strategy.toml`
3. Implement correlation risk management
4. Use time-based risk controls for market hours

### For All Users:
1. Always backtest strategies before live trading
2. Monitor the dashboard at http://localhost:3005
3. Set up alerts for unusual activity
4. Regularly review and adjust parameters based on performance
5. Never risk more than you can afford to lose

## Security Considerations

1. **Key Management**: Never store private keys in plain text files
2. **Configuration Access**: Restrict access to configuration files
3. **Network Security**: Use secure connections for all services
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep the bot updated with security patches
5. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor for suspicious activity

## Next Steps

1. Choose appropriate risk parameters for your experience level
2. Select one or two strategies to start with
3. Configure wallet keys securely
4. Run backtests to validate your setup
5. Start with paper trading before going live
6. Gradually increase position sizes as you gain confidence
