# Features Map Alignment with Snipping Bot Project

This document analyzes how the COMPLETE-FEATURES-MAP.MD aligns with the actual snipping bot project implementation and identifies gaps that need to be addressed.

## 1. Validation & Simulation (Paper Trading) - Strong Alignment

### Strong Alignments
- **Simulation Controls**: The project has configuration files that support simulation mode concepts
- **Risk & Sizing Sandbox**: Risk parameters are configurable via TOML files
- **Strategy Proving**: Multiple strategies are available in `configs/strategies/`
- **Observation & Monitoring**: Dashboard service exists at port 3005

### Implementation Gaps
- Missing dedicated `sniper-sim` crate for comprehensive simulation
- No formal simulation mode switch in the core configuration
- Limited parametric modeling for slippage/fees/latency

### Recommendations
1. Create a dedicated `sniper-sim` crate that handles virtual fills and market simulation
2. Add a global `simulation_mode` flag to the main configuration
3. Implement more sophisticated slippage and fee models

## 2. Hardening & Completeness (Implementation) - Partial Alignment

### Strong Alignments
- **Security Foundations**: `sniper-keys` crate exists with modules for Vault/KMS
- **Testing Battery**: Basic testing framework is in place
- **Performance & Reliability**: Async runtime with Tokio is used

### Implementation Gaps
- **Security Foundations**: Most security modules are placeholder files
- **Access Control & Auditability**: RBAC is mentioned but not implemented
- **Testing Battery**: Tests are mostly placeholders with low coverage
- **Security Audits & Compliance**: No formal audit process documented

### Recommendations
1. Implement the placeholder files in `sniper-keys` crate:
   - Complete Vault integration in `vault.rs`
   - Implement KMS integration in `kms.rs`
   - Add MPC support in `mpc.rs`
2. Create `sniper-authz` crate for RBAC implementation
3. Develop comprehensive test suite with proper coverage
4. Establish security audit procedures

## 3. Rollout & Scaling (Gradual Deployment) - Conceptual Alignment

### Strong Alignments
- **Conceptual Understanding**: The PRODUCT_ROADMAP.MD mentions phased approach
- **Documentation**: Clear documentation of rollout phases

### Implementation Gaps
- **Shadow Mode**: No actual implementation of observe-only mode
- **Live Sim**: Missing real-time market ingest with virtual fills
- **Scaling Mechanisms**: No automated scaling controls

### Recommendations
1. Implement shadow mode functionality in strategy services
2. Create live simulation mode with real market data processing
3. Add scaling controls with automated gates based on performance metrics

## 4. Operations & Governance - Partial Alignment

### Strong Alignments
- **Risk Management**: `sniper-risk` crate with position limits and honeypot detection
- **Observability & Alerting**: `sniper-telemetry` crate with Prometheus integration
- **Compliance & Record-Keeping**: Security compliance documentation exists

### Implementation Gaps
- **Operational Procedures**: Limited runbooks and procedures
- **Emergency Procedures**: Kill-switch implementation is minimal
- **Compliance & Record-Keeping**: No automated compliance checking

### Recommendations
1. Create comprehensive runbooks for operational procedures
2. Implement robust kill-switch mechanisms with proper controls
3. Add automated compliance checking features

## Configuration Alignment

The features map suggests specific configuration structures that could be aligned with the current project:

### Current Configuration Structure
```
configs/
├── chains/
├── strategies/
├── risk.toml
├── risk_comprehensive.toml
├── risk_simple.toml
├── routes.toml
└── secrets.example.toml
```

### Suggested Enhanced Structure
```
configs/
├── chains/
├── strategies/
├── risk/
│   ├── risk.toml
│   ├── risk_comprehensive.toml
│   └── risk_simple.toml
├── sim/
│   ├── simulation.toml
│   └── market_models.toml
├── security/
│   ├── vault.toml
│   ├── mTLS.toml
│   └── rbac.toml
├── ops/
│   ├── killswitch.toml
│   └── alerts.toml
├── routes.toml
└── secrets.example.toml
```

## Service Alignment

### Current Services
- `svc-gateway`
- `svc-strategy`
- `svc-executor`
- `svc-risk`
- `svc-cex`
- `svc-nft`
- `svc-policy`
- `svc-storage`
- `svc-dashboard`

### Suggested Additions Based on Features Map
- `svc-sim` - Simulation service
- `svc-authz` - Authorization service
- `svc-audit` - Audit logging service

## Conclusion

The COMPLETE-FEATURES-MAP.MD provides an excellent blueprint for a production trading system, but the current snipping bot implementation has significant gaps, particularly in security implementation and testing. 

To align the project with the features map:
1. Prioritize security implementation in the `sniper-keys` crate
2. Develop comprehensive testing capabilities
3. Create dedicated services for simulation and authorization
4. Enhance operational procedures and emergency controls

This alignment process should be done gradually, following the same phased approach described in both the features map and the PRODUCT_ROADMAP.MD.
